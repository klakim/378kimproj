Throughout this project, I was given the Palmer Penguins dataset and conducted some exploratory analysis. I learned tools to become a better data scientist and learned how to integrate myself with the IT/Admin team. Furthermore, I explored the environments of code, data project architecture, databases and data APIs, logging and monitoring, deployments and code promotion, and employing docker.

This dataset contains 3 different penguin species of Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. It also includes the island, bill_length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. I explored the impacts on mass throughout the Exploratory Data Analysis and the Model files.
